## ü§îÔ∏è Main Purpose

The main purpose behind this project is to enhance my understanding related to C 
language and to grab some main concepts of C language like pointers, file handling, file 
inclusion etc. I did't made this software for any commercial purpose.

However, if you have any kind of suggestion relatd to the software you can contact me on
my github account. I will try to remodify my project and try to inculcate your suggestion into the project.

## Running the software

Navigate to the bin directory of the repo.

Then execute the command

```bash
./start_page
```
For more information read the docs.

## üñêÔ∏è Instructions 

Since this project is terminal based so the whole program interface is a little bit old. 
I will make it graphical in any other version.

Every time you will be asked to navigate to the particular section of the project.

1. You can just simply type out your choice and hit enter.
2. When you want to search for something then simply navigate to the search page and 
type the keyword.
3. q is for quit out of the program.
4. When any particular book is loaded onto the system then simply exit out of the 
program by entering Ctrl+C in the terminal.
5. If you face any other kind of problem then contact me on github by creating issue. I 
will patch it as soon as possible.

## Basic Layout  

Well the whole system starts by asking for username and password.

The default username and passwords are:
* username: admin
* password: password

Then you get three options:
1. Books
2. News
3. Search

In the Books option you can navigate to a particular section of the book category and 
the book will load into your default pdf viewer. (Probably Evince)

In the News section you will see some the default news channels so you can just simply 
navigate to their website from there itself. The wesite will load into the default browser.

In the search section you can type out the particular category of the book to directly 
navigate to it. Or you can type out the name of the news channel you prefer to directly 
navigate to its website.

## Privacy policy 

This project does not take any logging data from any user. I care about the privacy of 
everyone. I support the open source revolution and this project is my very small step in 
the same.

## Sharing policy
You are free to share and distribute this software to anyone and anybody and if you have 
made something beautiful out of it then I would love to hear.
